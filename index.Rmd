The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of **age** and 
**ingredients**. 

***

These ingredients includes: 

* cement 
* blast 
* furnace 
* slag
* fly ash 
* water 
* superplasticizer
* coarse aggregate 
* fine aggregate.

NB: The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a *given mixture* under a 
specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. The data can be downloaded here: [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/concrete/compressive/)
